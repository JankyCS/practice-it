/*
Modify your code from the previous exercise (numbersOutput60)so that it could easily be modified to display a different range of numbers (instead of 1234567890) and a different number of repetitions of those numbers (instead of 60 total characters), with the vertical bars still matching up correctly. Write a complete class named NumbersOutput. Use two class constants instead of "magic numbers,", with one constant set to 6 for the number of repetitions, and the other set to 10 for the range of numbers. Put the for loop code in your class's main method.

For example, if your number-of-repetitions constant is set to 7 and your range constant is set to 5, the output should be the following:

    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
12340123401234012340123401234012340
(You must solve this problem using only exactly two public static final constants, no more, no less.)

//Answer
public class NumbersOutput{
    
    //Class Constants
    public static final int constant1=6;
    public static final int constant2=10;
    //Main method
    public static void main(String[] args){
        for (int i = 1; i <= constant1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= constant2-1; j++) {
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
            System.out.print("|");
        }

        System.out.println();
        
        for (int j=0;j<constant1;j++){ 

            for (int i=0;i<constant2-1;i++){
                System.out.print(i+1);
            }
            System.out.print("0");

        }
    }
}
